# Colour-rhythm
Level 1 Game Code
Level1 script, it currently adds one every sequence, I want it to add one until it hits 6, Once the player does the last sequence of 6, I will load another level.

The sequence makes the player have to memories the colour, then the player taps that same colour, the player will then have to remember 2 colours and then push 2 colours, and so on up to 6.
